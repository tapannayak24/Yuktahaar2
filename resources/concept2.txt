Meet Hemant, an engineering professional with a PG in management and a successful corporate background spanning over two decades. But,about 12 years ago, Hemant made a life-altering decision to seek a more meaningful, balanced, and sustainable existence.
Hemant’s commitment to sustainability led him to explore organic farming and the creation of natural cosmetic products. These practices align perfectly with his belief in preserving our environment and promoting holistic well-being.
Driven by a deep desire to harmonize with nature and live a purpose-driven life, Hemant immersed himself in the philosophy of “Madhyastha Darshan.” This co-existential philosophy, emphasizing interconnectedness, reshaped his outlook on life.
Today, Hemant dedicates his time to the study and application of philosophy, serving as a facilitator for organic, sustainable, and healthy produce, through an organization founded by him, called “Yuktahaar”. 
Supported wholeheartedly by his nutritionist wife, Swati, their venture embodies their shared vision of a limeer and healthier world.Join him on this transformative journey towards a more sustainable and balanced way of life, supported by Swati’s nutritional expertise. Together, they are here to inspire you to live in harmony with nature.
